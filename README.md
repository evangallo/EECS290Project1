===============

We have code from the TA that generates a 2D maze for us.

The simplest way we've thought of to use this to implement a 3D maze is to make that maze a 2D plane on the floor and extend vertically all squares that it draws as walls.

We'll need at least one enemy model. Animations for all models and sounds (pulibc domain if possible, we create them if not) also needed.
