Controls: WASD to move, ESC to pause/unpause, mouse to rotate the camera. F2 quits the game while it’s being played.

The thing that we’re the most proud of is implementing A*. It’s the most advanced pathfinding algorithm used by any group in the class. We’re also proud of our increasing maze sizes and our use of menus.

The biggest challenges were getting our monsters to move (both to move across the map and getting them to animate) and getting A* to work. Fortunately, Ian came through really well there.
